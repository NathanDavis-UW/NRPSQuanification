#Completed Things Today

+ learned about Biopython in general

+ began to look at IMGABC

+ began to look at NCBI entrez

+ learned about Biopython entrez package and parsing from websites into files as well as interpreting sequences using biopython

   + wrote code to do both of the above in the context of NRPS Qauntification

#things to do tommorow

+ Work on A second check and getting the program function with other databases like the porteinclusters database

+ the second check will be a seperate functino or object that will be acted on each of the files afterwards

+ look a little bit more at how NRPS work for inspiration on how to furhter cut down on results and to categorize them further

+ see what you can do IMG ABC a little bit more rather than just NCBI
