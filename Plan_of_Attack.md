#Plan of Attack
This is the plan in a general sense of how to approach the nrps project
##Step 1: obtain database
Obtain a database containing all of the nrps that will be looked at

Tools to do this:

+ IMGABC

##Step 2: Analyze for Function
Analyze to find import fuctions attached to amino acid strands

Tools to do this:

+ antiSMASH

##Step 3: Qauntify Differences Between nrps
Use an algorithm, possibley sum matrix, to qantify the difference between the nrps's

Tools to do this:

+ python
+ biopython

##Step 4: Assign Coordinates
Use qauntification to assign each nrps coordinates on a 2d grid, this should be based on their value and similarity to other
    
    This will take more work than anything else

Tools to do this:

+ Itol
+ python
+ bioPython
+ Pandas
