## MLTreeMap
This is given a set of DNA sequences and then creates a tree of life based around how similar they are based on key enzymes, Phylogenetic markers, functional markers. They then visualize this as a tree. This could be useful to see how others have created tree programs and possibly to harness to some extent on this project
