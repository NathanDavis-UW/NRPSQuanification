# Categorization of Programs
## Jupyter
Jupyter is a program that lets you share code from 40 different coding languages with a focus on application to stem and science more spefically. 
## anti-smash
anti smash is a program that combines a variety of differnt tools with the purpose of location secondaryt metablolism of bacteria and fungi. These can be used to find anitbbioticsm cholesterol-lowering drugs, and anti tumor drugs. This is how we can find most or four nrps for the diversity tree.
## Blast
Is a program used ot find similar regions on multiple different amino acid sequences. It can then infer fucional and evolutionary relationships.
## python
A dynamically typed coding language that is object oriented and uses functions similar to methods in java, this will be the program that any scripts or functions will be written in
## Itol
This is a program that allows you to create tree with html 5 or javascript, they are highly costimazable and scalable and might be a good choice for the creation of our tree

## MLTreeMap
This is given a set of DNA sequences and then creates a tree of life based around how similar they are based on key enzymes, Phylogenetic markers, functional markers. They then visualize this as a tree. This could be useful to see how others have created tree programs and possibly to harness to some extent on this project
